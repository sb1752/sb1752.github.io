I've spent the last decade working in tech as a product manager and software engineer. I left in 2019 to explore my interests in science, philosophy and art. Some of my writings and meditations can be found here. I am now dedicating myself full-time to Bitcoin; as an engineer, investor, writer and educator.

Bitcoin is one of the most important humanitarian initiatives of the 21st century. Not only does it offer monetary freedom for countless people living under oppressive regimes, it acts as a counterforce to the alarming rise of authoritarianism and censorship in the first world. Bitcoin is a movement on par with the Democratic revolution. And it is a technological innovation on par with the printing press, the airplane, the automobile and the internet.

  <h1>Language is a Technology</h1>
  <p>January 2021</p>
</div>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Much like the air we breathe, we are immersed in a vast atmosphere of words without giving it a second thought. But unlike breathing, language — conveying complex meaning through the use of symbols — is not an automatic biological process but a human invention<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This makes it no different than any other technology whether that be fire, the gun or the computer. It is the primary reason that we are at the top of the food chain despite not being the fittest animal as it has enabled us to collaborate in large tribes and use the laws of nature to our advantage.</p>

<p>However, as a technology, language can and often is abused. This has become increasingly apparent today, whether that is in culture or politics or even science. Conversation among differing viewpoints seem fruitless as people talk past one another. Instead of a productive engagement, we devolve into condescension, hyperbole, hypocrisy and falsehoods. This is a reminder that human communication is not a neutral system by which objective information is communicated. Words are not what they mean. Words are what they achieve.</p>

<p>This may sound obvious and perhaps even trivial, but I find that people are largely unaware of this fundamental reality. Does the individual who retorts with “lol” in an online argument actually find the opposing view hilarious? Does the politician who says we must stay inside our homes during a pandemic actually believe that himself? Does the liberal who labels any conservative a “Nazi” actually know what a Nazi is? How about the conservative who shouts down any moderately liberal policy as a “socialist communist takeover”?</p>

<p>Rather than being objective maps of reality, words are symbols that carry energy. They induce a current to power the most complex machine on the planet — the human mind — via its emotional pathways. The very etymology of the word “emotion” originates in French and Latin meaning “to move” and “agitate”. Laughter in heated arguments evokes condescension and authority. Invoking “Nazi”, “Hitler” and other charged labels is an easy way to demonize and dismiss a different point of view without actually doing the hard work of engaging it and challenging your own perspective (it also diminishes what is a truly horrific period of human history)<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. In other words, language is rarely about Truth. It is about Power.</p>

<p>Humans can come up with any reason and any combination of words, noises and images to justify their goal. It does not matter what the symbols mean and whether statements are objectively true (or have objective perspective) as long as there is an emotional response. The goal is almost always the same — tribal status, power or a sense of control. If the right phrase / imagery inflates my ego, improves my status or energizes my particular tribe by demonizing the other, then the words are useful and effective. That is all that matters, regardless of double standards and moral hypocrisy.</p>

<p>This is obviously an abuse of what is the base technology layer of human civilization. All other technologies are built upon this most basic one. And if this one becomes corrupted, so too goes the rest. We’ve already proven this with the way we treat the planet and the tremendous harm we inflict on each other with powerful weapons. We’re witnessing the corruption of our institutions, news media and technology companies that promote polarizing content and increasingly censor views that don’t serve them profitably. And a rigged financial system that favors only a handful of elites. As much as we like to point blame, we are also complicit, justifying the corruption whenever it serves our tribal interests and only shouting when it doesn’t, invariably choosing Power over Truth and allowing the cycle to continue.</p>

<p>But there is reason to be hopeful. Language is not always directed toward goals of tribal domination and self-aggrandizement. There have always been exceptions and those exceptions are the foundation upon which progress has been made over the centuries. The courageous revolutionaries have always been those artists, scientists and engineers who harnessed the power of symbols to illuminate Truth. They have shown us that we share a common humanity and spirit. That races and genders are equal, deserving of equal treatment and dignity. That society should not be divided into kings and peasants, masters and slaves. They have given us the laws of physics and developed engineering marvels. Their insights transcend tribal identities and narrow-minded ideologies.</p>

<p>Given the state of the world, we have no choice but to take up the mantle of those that came before us. To do justice to this great technology that we inherit and to use it responsibly. This requires courage because at the moment, there are very few of us. But I would like to lend my voice in support of this cause and hopefully inspire others to do the same. I am by no means perfect, but to the best of my ability, I pledge to use my words consciously, thoughtfully and honestly. To pursue Truth over Power. To listen, understand, persuade and heal rather than dominate, demean, censor and destroy. If enough of us use this technology responsibly, who knows what could happen? Maybe we’ll be surprised at how quickly and dramatically the world changes for the better.</p>

      <p>We may actually be hardwired to think and speak in symbols. However, we do not come out of the womb knowing how to speak English, for example. We have to be taught a specific language system which therefore makes it an invention even if it’s based on our natural biological proclivities. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Trump and the so-called “alt-right” are obviously great examples of hyperbolic rhetoric as well, but this has already been widely exposed by media platforms culminating in a <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/merkel-calls-trumps-twitter-ban-problematic" target="_blank">mass purge</a>. Far too little attention has been paid to the hyperbolic and irresponsible rhetoric on the left that is also damaging to discourse and ultimately handicaps congress’ ability to legislate effectively. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>We all know of the well's existence</p>
<p>
  For some, it is an old structure<br/>
  A trivial relic
</p>
<p>
  For others, it is a hazard<br/>
  A place where people disappear
</p>
<p>
  To look down into its depths is terrifying, dizzying<br/>
  It is vast, dark, empty, silent
</p>
<p>
  Yet time and again it calls to us<br/>
  With faint whispers
</p>
<p>
  The scientists devise clever experiments<br/>
  Dropping objects<br/>
  Then observing, calculating
</p>
<p>
  The philosophers bring their rope<br/>
  Carefully descending<br/>
  Always looking up to the light<br/>
</p>
<p>
  But none are more daring than the mystics<br/>
  They go unhindered, unprotected, untethered<br/>
  They fall<br/>
  With reckless abandon
</p>

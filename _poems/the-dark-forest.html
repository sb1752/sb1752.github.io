<p>
  The settlers huddle near the fire<br/>
  Comforted by its warmth<br/>
  Entranced by its light
</p>

<p>
  How it illuminates their small world<br/>
  How beautifully it reflects upon their faces
</p>

<p>
  Yet the ones that shine the brightest<br/>
  Stand closest to the fire<br/>
  Blinded by it's light<br/>
  Singed by its flickering embers
</p>

<p>
  The nomads stay at the edges<br/>
  Peering into the unknown<br/>
  Their pupils expanded<br/>
  Their breath chilly and full
</p>

<p>
  Among them are the silent heroes<br/>
  Who venture into that dark forest
</p>

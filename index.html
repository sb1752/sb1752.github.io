<div class="intro">
  <p>I've spent the last decade working in tech as a product manager and software engineer. I'm now taking some time off to explore my interest in philosophy and the arts. I plan to share my thoughts here. Some will be more logical arguments in the form of essays, others more artistic in the form of poetry and short fiction.</p>
  <p>Topics will likely be all over the place, but I tend to read and think a lot about political systems, economics, and the philosophy of science, particularly what these subjects reveal about human nature.</p>

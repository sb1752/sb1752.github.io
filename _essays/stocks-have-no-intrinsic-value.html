title: Stocks have no intrinsic value
summary: It is often taught in business school and preached by fund managers that stocks are essentially pieces of a business which has some intrinsic value. The investor need only purchase the stock when its market price is below a conservatively calculated valuation. I challenge this widely held belief and propose that all value is strictly extrinsic.
